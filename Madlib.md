I went to the beach that is popular with my enthusiastic family. During the trip me and my brother played videogames. When we got to the beach I stepped on a sea urchin. So I got sick from the venom and had to eat disgusting fish and rice. But I did get better and swam at the beach. Eventually we went home and the ride was very relaxing.
